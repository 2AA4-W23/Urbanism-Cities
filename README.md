## How to run the product

To run the product, mvn clean --> mvn install --> mvn package must be called, and then change directory to directory 'generator' and call:

```
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
```

to generate the generator. Then back out one directory, and move into the 'visualizer' directory and call:

```
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg
```

to generate the visualizer.

The above steps need to be completed until a non-blank sample.svg file is produced. These steps likely need to be called several times. This problem has been persistent since the first time we cloned the repository and it has not subsided.

You can call the options listed below to generate an irregular mesh, a square grid, or to show a help menu. If no option is listed, the project will build a default irregular mesh.

```
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -i
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -g
java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh -h
```

To activate debug mode in the visualizer for the square grid mesh, call the command below:

```
java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg -X
```

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one.

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes one single argument (so far), the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator %
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go to the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take two arguments (so far): the file containing the mesh, and the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```

To viualize the SVG file:

- Open it with a web browser
- Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.

## Backlog

### Definition of Done

A feature is done when its function is functional. It does not need to be the most beautiful or efficient code, but it needs to work according to its description.
